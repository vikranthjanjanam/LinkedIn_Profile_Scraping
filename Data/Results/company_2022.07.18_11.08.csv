Paperwheel,https://www.linkedin.com/company/42352720/about/,"Letterpress and design studio. 

Paperwheel Press is a letterpress print studio nestled in Portola Valley, California. Elizabeth Weil founded Paperwheel in 2006 after falling in love with a single letterpress business card while working in venture capital on Sand Hill Road. She started learning anything she could about the lost art of printing. Elizabeth combined her passions for hand-crafted tactile letterpress printing and the lasting art of the handwritten note to create simple, yet impactful, greeting cards and custom-designed wedding invitations, announcements, personal stationery, and more.

Elizabeth trail runs each morning, is an investor in the Silicon Valley by day, and prints and designs by night, weekends, and any other second she gets. She is an ultra-marathon runner, and in fact swears that that‚Äôs when she thinks of her best ideas.

The Paperwheel studio is home to a 1923 and a 1929 Chandler and Price Platen Press and an old-school guillotine paper cutter.
