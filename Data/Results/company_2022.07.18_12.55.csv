Gtmhub | The world's most intuitive OKRs platform,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10152848/about/,"The best part about building OKR software is having a front row seat as our clients get OKR ‚Äúreligion.‚Äù

Take, for example, the story of one customer, a 16 office ‚Äòmittelstand‚Äô manufacturing firm in Germany, which experienced successive years of significant growth. They needed to a better way to orchestrate the company‚Äôs growth across various functions, particularly in highly uncertain times.

One executive, Christiane, volunteered to lead the initiative.

Early in the project, Christiane learned of OKRs-a proven methodology for sustainable organizational growth that was made famous by Intel and Google.  OKRs track overall group achievement while also keeping individuals accountable to the group.

OKRs via Excel would simply not work, so she began to look for a software platform.

That is when she came to Gtmhub-with 3 criteria.

-Highly customizable to the unique needs of her company
A few minutes of searching will uncover the importance of customizing OKRs to organizations, functions, and teams.

-high degrees of automation in updating key results
Few co-workers would adopt OKRs if it became another ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list of manual tasks.

-Global Alignment Maps
Christiane knew that the OKR skeptics were most likely to come around if they saw how all the pieces aligned with each other.

A reality of the OKR SaaS business is that mastery of OKRs as a discipline takes time. Like sticking to a diet or exercise, initial progress is slow for anyone. That is why training and coaching is so important.

However, there is a moment after about 3-6 months where it starts to ‚Äúclick.‚Äù  

The former OKR skeptics become believers. The rest of the company becomes evangelists.

For Christiane, the proof was in the sales number.  With the help of OKRs, they were outperforming their pre-OKR stretch goals by 42%.

ViaCyte is a privately held regenerative medicine company developing novel cell replacement therapies as potential long-term diabetes treatments to achieve glucose control targets and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and diabetes-related complications. ViaCyte‚Äôs product candidates are based on directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into PEC-01 pancreatic islet progenitor cells, which are then implanted in durable and retrievable cell delivery devices. ViaCyte demonstrated that when effectively engrafted, PEC-01 cells can mature into glucose-responsive insulin producing cells in patients with type 1 diabetes. To accelerate and expand its efforts, ViaCyte has established collaborative partnerships with leading companies including CRISPR Therapeutics and W.L. Gore & Associates.

About ViaCyte‚Äôs Pipeline 

The PEC-Direct product candidate, currently being evaluated in the clinic, delivers ViaCyte‚Äôs PEC-01 cells (pancreatic islet progenitor cells) in a non-immunoprotective device and is being developed for type 1 diabetes patients who have hypoglycemia unawareness, extreme glycemic lability, and/or recurrent severe hypoglycemic episodes. The PEC-Encap (also known as VC-01) product candidate, also undergoing clinical evaluation, delivers the same pancreatic islet progenitor cells but in an immunoprotective device. PEC-Encap is being developed for all patients with type 1 diabetes. In collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, ViaCyte is developing immune-evasive stem cell lines from its proprietary CyT49 cell line. These immune-evasive stem cell lines, which are being used in the PEC-QT program, have the potential to further broaden the availability of cell therapy for all patients with insulin-requiring diabetes, type 1 and type 2.  In addition, a pluripotent, immune evasive cell line has the potential to be used to produce any cell in the body, thus enabling many other potential indications.",http://www.viacyte.com,,Biotechnology Research,51-200 employees,121 employees on LinkedIn,"San Diego, CA",,"Regenerative Medicine, Diabetes, and Cell Therapy"
