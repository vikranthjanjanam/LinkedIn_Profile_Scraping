(2009 - 2012) Seeing how the internet landscape was changing, and that users were switching to blog and publish on new platforms like Facebook and Twitter, we felt the time was right to go back to our roots and better serve local businesses. We build a local business listings and reviews directory. A decision was later made to close down the old publishing platform and focus on the new products, making Jeeran, the ""Yelp"" of the Arab World.The concept of reviews was totally new in our region. As CPO, I was responsible for shaping the new product and tailoring it for Arab audiences, managing the product teams and KPIs, and experimenting with data acquisition strategies. During this time the product teams tackled deep challenges in semantic search -both in Arabic and English- and created definitions for terminologies and use cases where there were no previous examples, starting with Arabizing the word ""Review"".My responsibilities also included setting up a User Experience department working with user-centric methodologies and processes that put user research and feedback first. The UX team was able to understand user needs and design web, mobile web, and smartphone apps with great success.Between (2009-2012) we had built the #1 local listings and reviews platform in the Arab World, and attracted investment from 500 Startups, Intel Capital, Fadi Ghandour (Aramex), Rabea Ataya (Bayt), SeedCamp, and follow-on investments from ATH."

It turned out that individuals were more interested in creating home pages than businesses were, so we decided to pivot, rebrand, and relaunch what later became the leading self publishing platform in the Middle East.In the early years, I was responsible for UI Design, and the development of user-facing products in classic ASP (asp 3.0). Took flagship product from a simple web-based file manager to a full fledged site builder that -by 2007- saw over 600,000 websites built on top of it. The site builder allowed user to pick a theme and customize layout and content. It also included widgets like page counter, guest book, e-mail forms, and a mailing list manager.In 2002 we started providing a bi-lingual interface, and my responsibilities included Arabic/English UI text writing (for the interface elements)."
