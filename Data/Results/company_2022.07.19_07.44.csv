Gtmhub | The world's most intuitive OKRs platform,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10152848/about/,"The best part about building OKR software is having a front row seat as our clients get OKR ‚Äúreligion.‚Äù

Take, for example, the story of one customer, a 16 office ‚Äòmittelstand‚Äô manufacturing firm in Germany, which experienced successive years of significant growth. They needed to a better way to orchestrate the company‚Äôs growth across various functions, particularly in highly uncertain times.

One executive, Christiane, volunteered to lead the initiative.

Early in the project, Christiane learned of OKRs-a proven methodology for sustainable organizational growth that was made famous by Intel and Google.  OKRs track overall group achievement while also keeping individuals accountable to the group.

OKRs via Excel would simply not work, so she began to look for a software platform.

That is when she came to Gtmhub-with 3 criteria.

-Highly customizable to the unique needs of her company
A few minutes of searching will uncover the importance of customizing OKRs to organizations, functions, and teams.

-high degrees of automation in updating key results
Few co-workers would adopt OKRs if it became another ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list of manual tasks.

-Global Alignment Maps
Christiane knew that the OKR skeptics were most likely to come around if they saw how all the pieces aligned with each other.

A reality of the OKR SaaS business is that mastery of OKRs as a discipline takes time. Like sticking to a diet or exercise, initial progress is slow for anyone. That is why training and coaching is so important.

However, there is a moment after about 3-6 months where it starts to ‚Äúclick.‚Äù  

The former OKR skeptics become believers. The rest of the company becomes evangelists.

For Christiane, the proof was in the sales number.  With the help of OKRs, they were outperforming their pre-OKR stretch goals by 42%. 

We have partnered ever since.

ViaCyte is a privately held regenerative medicine company developing novel cell replacement therapies as potential long-term diabetes treatments to achieve glucose control targets and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and diabetes-related complications. ViaCyte‚Äôs product candidates are based on directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into PEC-01 pancreatic islet progenitor cells, which are then implanted in durable and retrievable cell delivery devices. ViaCyte demonstrated that when effectively engrafted, PEC-01 cells can mature into glucose-responsive insulin producing cells in patients with type 1 diabetes. To accelerate and expand its efforts, ViaCyte has established collaborative partnerships with leading companies including CRISPR Therapeutics and W.L. Gore & Associates.

About ViaCyte‚Äôs Pipeline 

The PEC-Direct product candidate, currently being evaluated in the clinic, delivers ViaCyte‚Äôs PEC-01 cells (pancreatic islet progenitor cells) in a non-immunoprotective device and is being developed for type 1 diabetes patients who have hypoglycemia unawareness, extreme glycemic lability, and/or recurrent severe hypoglycemic episodes. The PEC-Encap (also known as VC-01) product candidate, also undergoing clinical evaluation, delivers the same pancreatic islet progenitor cells but in an immunoprotective device. PEC-Encap is being developed for all patients with type 1 diabetes. In collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, ViaCyte is developing immune-evasive stem cell lines from its proprietary CyT49 cell line. These immune-evasive stem cell lines, which are being used in the PEC-QT program, have the potential to further broaden the availability of cell therapy for all patients with insulin-requiring diabetes, type 1 and type 2.  In addition, a pluripotent, immune evasive cell line has the potential to be used to produce any cell in the body, thus enabling many other potential indications.",http://www.viacyte.com,,Biotechnology Research,51-200 employees,120 employees on LinkedIn,"San Diego, CA",,"Regenerative Medicine, Diabetes, and Cell Therapy"

The solution is powered by DvC‚Ñ¢ (data vs. code), a patented, real-time, signature-less engine. DvC assumes that there is no legitimate reason for executable code to be present in any data file. As such, it does not rely on heuristics or behaviors (which are core limitations of competing technologies), and definitively identifies and terminates any instance of malicious code such as hidden CPU instructions,  encrypted and polymorphic payloads, shellcodes and other commands typically buried in data file. DvC also accurately identifies an blocks malicious active content using advanced flow analysis, de-obfuscation techniques and deep content evaluation, to reveal threat intent within any inbound data file covering machine, operating system and application levels, thereby rendering such sandbox evading attacks harmless to the enterprise.

Solebit was founded in 2014 by a team of world-class cybersecurity experts, all graduates of the elite technology units in the Israel Defense Forces with years of experience in offensive and defensive security. It counts a variety of leading global financial organizations, tech, defense contractors, security vendors, cloud and telecom service providers as active customers.

YourPhysio is driven by the goal of providing relief to people with back & joint pain problems. With the rise in sedentary jobs, chronic conditions, and unhealthy lifestyles - back & joint pain are the modern-day epidemic. It is very hard to find good quality physiotherapists near to our home. Since you have to go to a physiotherapy center on a daily basis, traveling is a big problem in seeking physiotherapy treatment. Even in our own physiotherapy centers in Nagpur, we have seen patients dropping out if they have to travel more than 5 Km for their treatment every day. In addition to this, most of the patients are unaware of the progress metrics during the physiotherapy treatment as very few physiotherapists in India provide clear and objective progress metrics to the patients.

At Yourphysio, our aim is to provide the best quality physiotherapy care at the click of a button. We want to leverage the power of technology to make sure that we are able to provide objective and clear progress metrics to our patients. We are building a system where we are able to provide real-time feedback to our patients about every exercise and share their progress by the use of objective metrics. The patient doesn't have to travel anywhere and he can get access to India's best physiotherapists at the click of a button.

Illusive,https://www.linkedin.com/company/6432514/about/,"At Illusive, we know that defenders want to be in command of their security.

We understand how frustrating it is to invest so much and still feel like attackers have the upper hand. We believe defenders deserve to win. 

Illusive reduces cyber risk by shrinking the attack surface and stopping attacker movement. Illusive creates a hostile environment for attackers, depriving them of the means to progress towards critical assets after breaching the perimeter. Hackers are increasingly finding more vulnerabilities within an enterprise‚Äôs security stack, allowing them to move laterally within the network and conduct reconnaissance and exfiltration. Illusive‚Äôs Active Defense identifies and removes the vulnerable connections and credentials that enable attackers to move undetected, and then replaces them with deceptive versions that fool attackers into revealing their presence upon engagement. Unlike behavioral or anomaly-based threat detection, Illusive‚Äôs agentless approach captures deterministic proof of in-progress attacks and provides actionable forensics to empower a quick and effective response. Illusive detects Advanced Persistent Threats, targeted ransomware and malicious insiders in ways that supplement other defensive technologies, allowing security teams to beat both attackers and red teams alike. 

Illusive is the first company spun out of the company-building venture group Team8, which was co-founded by veterans of Israel's military intelligence division, Unit 8200.
